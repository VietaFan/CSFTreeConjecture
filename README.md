# CSFTreeConjecture
Contains C++ code to verify Richard Stanley's conjecture that the chromatic symmetric function distinguishes distinct trees, on at most 27 vertices.

This project was inspired by Keeler Russell's verification of the conjecture for all trees with at most 25 vertices, given here: https://github.com/keeler/csf, but uses an alternate algorithm to allow a greater volume of trees to be processed.
